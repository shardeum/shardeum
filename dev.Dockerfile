# NOTE: This Dockerfile compiles an image that uses Debian Stretch as its OS
#
# Build time is fast because the native modules used by our app
# (sodium-native, sqlite3) have precomiled binaries for Debian.
#
# However, the resulting image size is very large (~1.25GB).
#
# Useful for development, but don't ship it. Use 'Dockerfile' instead.
